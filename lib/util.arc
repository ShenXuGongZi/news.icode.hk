(mac withf (fns . body)
  " Defines a set `fns' of mutually recursive local fns within `body'. Each
    three elements of `fn' correspond to a fn name, argument list, and body,

    Example:

      arc> (withf (is-even (x) (case x 0 t (is-odd (- x 1)))
                   is-odd (x) (case x 0 nil (is-even (- x 1))))

      arc> (where (square x)
              square [* _ _]
              x 2)
      4

    Note that binding is recursive, but that actual assignment of values is done
    in the reverse of the order given, so any variables which are both bound and
    used in `parms' must be used in reverse dependency order:

      arc> (where x x (+ y y) y 0)    ; this works as expected
      y
      arc> (where x y 0 x (+ y y))    ; this doesn't
      nil

    Essentially, this is a reversed form of Scheme's 'letrec,
    with many fewer parentheses. Inspired by Haskell's \"where\".
