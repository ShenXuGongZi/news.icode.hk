A 'require form has been added to libs.arc. 'require takes a filename and loads
it if and only if it has not been required before. 'require, like load,
interprets paths relative to the current directory.

Currently you can fool 'require by giving it a different name for the same file
(giving an absolute versus relative path, or prefixing with "./"). This is
considered a bug and may be fixed in future. Another possible future feature is
reloading a file if it has changed (as determined by its mtime, probably) since
it was last required.

'require was added to libs.arc rather than being in load/ so that autoloaded
files can use it for load-ordering; see CHANGES/autoload.
