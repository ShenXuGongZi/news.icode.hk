From http://arclanguage.org/item?id=10123:

Vanilla arc3 has the 'open-socket and 'socket-accept functions for receiving
connections. This hack defines 'socket-connect to establish outgoing
connections:

    (socket-connect host port) => (in-stream out-stream)

Also, 'flushout is extended to deal with ports other than (stdout). This is not
strictly necessary, but useful if you're sending data with 'writec or 'writeb.

    (flushout (o out-stream (stdout)))

Usage example:

    (let (in out) (socket-connect "www.google.com" 80)
      (w/stdout out
        (prn "GET /index.html HTTP/1.0")
        (prn "Host: www.google.com")
        (prn))
      (while (prn:readline in))
      (close in out))
